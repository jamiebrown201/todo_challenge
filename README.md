LIVE: http://todolistapp-58561.onmodulus.net/

This is a restarted repository because some files got corrupted and atom went crazy.

I have used a MEAN stack for this weekend challenge. I used Node.js and Express for my server along with a remotely hosted MongoDB at modulus.io. The todolist runs on angular and is styled using bootstrap. I designed it to be dynamic so as to be viewable on all size screens.

MORE TESTING COMING SOON.
